                Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
            </h3>
            <p>By Robert Frost</p>
            <pre>
                Whose woods these are I think I know.   
                His house is in the village though;   
                He will not see me stopping here   
                To watch his woods fill up with snow.   
    
                My little horse must think it queer   
                To stop without a farmhouse near   
                Between the woods and frozen lake   
                The darkest evening of the year.   
    
                He gives his harness bells a shake   
                To ask if there is some mistake.   
                The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
                Of easy wind and downy flake.   
    
                The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
                But I have promises to keep,   
                And miles to go before I sleep,   
                And miles to go before I sleep.
            </pre>
